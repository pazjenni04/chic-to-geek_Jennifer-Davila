This webpage is vital in showcasing not only my current projects (and potential future projects), but also my background as an upcoming web developer.  I tailored the theme of my webpage to exemplify a great love of mine, cats.  As an individual navigates through the webpage, they'll be able to get a sense of my personality and first-hand see my progress as a developer.

About me section - 
Under this section I felt it was important to mention my brief experience within web developing and express my willingness to continue to learn and push outside of my comfort zone.  Also, to personalize this section a bit, I added just a brief intro to my hobbies and interests.  The images on this section captures my personality and my current passions in life in order to differentiate myself to others and seem more impressionable.

Work section -
Under this section, I have one current repository/project to showcase.  I felt it was necessary to include placeholders for future projects to link once completed.

Contact info - 
Finally, under this section I included 3 main points of contact -- email, Github profile, and LinkedIn.  As I begin to network and make my way into other social medias I will update and include them in the empty areas to the right of the others.  The email, Github, and LinkedIn options are all linked to my personal email, github and LinkedIn for the ease of reaching me.

As one navigates through the page, they'll be able to click on the top buttons "About Me,""Work," and "Contact" which are each linked to specific sections of my webpage.  This feature was included to create an expedited way to get to the important sections on the page without having to spend time scrolling through.

Also, another feature added within the page were alts to assist with images.

Lastly, I added media queries to assist with the dimensions of each element to ensure that the viewport is maximized as the user switches over different window dimensions.
